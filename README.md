Hello! This is the backend for the Single Resource Project. This was created by sourcing information from Steam ('https://steamdb.info/charts/') where they list out very broad data for every video game on their platform. I have included 17 games in the seed.sql file to start the project off, but feel free to add as many as you would like. 
The BASEURL for this backend is 'https://single-resource-backend.onrender.com/'. To take a look at all video games at once add '...videogames' and to look up a certain video game write 'BASEURL/videogames/videogameId'. in addition each game has a more in depth look, which can be view by typing 'BASEURL/videogames/videogameId/abouts'.
This will be connected to a frontend via Jerry Johns frontend part of this project.
Thank You!
